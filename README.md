# Simple SQLite3 Source integration for Unreal Engine 4

Based on [SQLite3UE4 Plugin by Jussi Saarivirta & KhArtNJava](https://github.com/KhArtNJava/SQLite3UE4/) but with compiling SQLite3 as part of the module code, this opens up compiling it (hopefully) on all platforms without any extra process.

Please report any problems to the [issues tracker](https://github.com/cindustries/unreal-sqlite3/issues) on this GitHub, or join us at [#unrealengine on irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#unrealengine)), you can msg me under **Getty**.

# Usage

Copy this plugin (like Download as ZIP) into the folder **Plugins/CISQLite3** on your project and a start of the project should compile the plugin automatically, if the project is C++, but you can prepare a C++ project and copy over to your Blueprint project, or install as Engine Plugin in the Engine Plugins directory.
